# Makito

Makito is a dummy app market for Android - one that can not be used to install or upgrade apps. Instead, Makito focuses on two things:

1. receiving "view in market" requests once set as the default market app, and redirects to different markets based on which app it is, and
2. blocking "view in market" requests for certain apps.

(Working in progress.)
